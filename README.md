# putbp - Push-up to Bench Press Calculator


So...

🎉 I made my first website! 🎉

It's called **Push-Up to Bench Press Calculator** (catchy name, I know). The site takes your bodyweight and the amount of push-ups you can do then estimates the weight you can bench press.

Here's why I made it:
* **Curiosity**. I've never been much of a gym-goer and have preferred working out from home so wanted to know how what I can do translates to the weight room.
* **Covid**. When gyms shut down we all had to exercise at home. This site could help with getting people back to bench pressing a safe weight once they return to the gym.
* **Injury**. Having had a few injuries myself, I know how it feels to be knocked back and have to build up strength from an earlier progression. Heavy bench pressing can be a little harder on the joints than push-ups so this site could help set realistic goals when returning to weight training after some bodyweight rehab.

Push-Up to Bench Press Calculator uses the Epley Formula to estimate out your flat bench press 1-rep max, and assumes that a push-up requires pushing 64% of your bodyweight. This website does not contain any fitness advice and is for entertainment purposes only.
