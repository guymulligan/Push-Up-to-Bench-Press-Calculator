# putbp - Push-up to Bench Press Calculator


So...

ðŸŽ‰ I made my first website! ðŸŽ‰

It's called Push-Up to Bench Press Calculator (catchy name, I know). The site takes your bodyweight and the amount of push-ups you can do then estimates the weight you can bench press.

Here's why I made it:
* Curiosity. I've never been much of a gym-goer and have preferred working out from home so wanted to know how what I can do translates to the weight room.
* Covid. When gyms shut down we all had to exercise at home. This site could help with getting people back to bench pressing a safe weight once they return to the gym.
* Injury. Having had a few injuries myself, I know how it feels to be knocked back and have to build up strength from an earlier progression. Heavy bench pressing can be a little harder on the joints than push-ups so this site could help set realistic goals when returning to weight training after some bodyweight rehab.
